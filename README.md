# Weather Forecast App #

This repository contains the code for the weather app I developed after completing the SheCodes Foundation's Plus Workshop. The application provides users with the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city they search. It is open-source, hosted on Netlify, and accessible at this link: [Weather Forecast App](https://my-weather-app-krld77.netlify.app).

The SheCodes Plus Workshop is a self-paced online coding workshop designed for beginners. Key skills I acquired during the workshop include:
* Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Familiarity with tools like VSCode, API usage, GitHub, and web hosting
* Application of advanced JavaScript techniques (ES6) for building an interactive weather forecast application
* Integration of a live API to dynamically fetch and display current weather data.
